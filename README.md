# Basic Time Tracker App
A really basic, simple time management app built using a full MEAN stack. This version is **incomplete** but it served its purpose as a school assignment.

## Getting set up
Here's the instructions for getting this set up and running.

1. In both the `backend` and `frontend` folders, install the dependencies using `npm install`.
2. Create a `.env` environment file in the `backend` folder, then run `npm start`.
3. In the `frontend` folder, run `ng build --aot --prod` to build the Angular frontend, then run `npm start`.

## TODOs
Here's some stuff I planned for this version, but never got around to implementing. If you'd like to implement these, go right ahead. You might even make a cool app from it all!

- Time statistics on the Dashboard
- Time reports using graphs, bars, numbers, and all that fun stuff
- Implemented travel times, rates, wages, and other fancy numbers
- An improved date/time picker
